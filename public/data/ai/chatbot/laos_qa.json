      "question": "What is Laos' current population and demographic characteristics?",
      "answer": "Laos has a population of approximately 7.4 million people with a young demographic profile. About 38% live in urban areas, with rapid urbanization at 3.3% annually. The population density is low at 32 people per km² due to mountainous terrain and concentrated settlements in river valleys. Age distribution shows 33% youth (0-24), 60% adults (25-64), and 7% elderly (65+). The country has 49 ethnic groups with Lao (55%), Khmu (11%), and Hmong (8%) being the largest. Literacy rates have improved to 85% overall, with continuing efforts to close rural-urban gaps.",

      "question": "How is Laos' energy infrastructure developed and what are the main sources?",
      "answer": "Laos' energy sector is dominated by hydropower, which provides over 80% of electricity generation with installed capacity of 10,000+ MW. Major projects include Nam Theun 2, Sekaman 1, and Nam Ngiep 1. The country is becoming the 'Battery of Southeast Asia' by exporting surplus electricity to Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Rural electrification has reached 95% through grid extension and off-grid solar systems. Coal-fired thermal plants contribute 15% of capacity for baseload power. Future development focuses on additional hydropower projects along the Mekong mainstream and tributaries, plus solar farms in southern provinces. The power grid connects to all ASEAN neighbors for regional electricity trade.",

      "question": "What climate challenges does Laos face and how are they being addressed?",
      "answer": "Laos faces significant climate vulnerabilities with temperature increases of 1.3°C since 1960 and changing monsoon patterns. The country experiences increased extreme weather including severe droughts (2015-2016, 2019-2020) and intense flooding during monsoon seasons. Climate change affects the Mekong River system, crucial for hydropower, agriculture, and fisheries. Impacts include reduced water levels affecting power generation, saltwater intrusion in the delta region, and shifting precipitation patterns disrupting rice cultivation. Laos' National Climate Change Strategy focuses on climate-resilient agriculture, early warning systems, and sustainable forest management. The country maintains 65% forest coverage and emphasizes nature-based solutions for climate adaptation.",

      "question": "What are the major geographical regions in Laos and their characteristics?",
      "answer": "Laos is divided into three main geographical zones and 18 provinces. The Northern Region (Luang Prabang, Phongsaly, Oudomxai) features mountainous terrain with ethnic diversity and tourism centers. The Central Region (Vientiane, Bolikhamxai, Khammouan) contains the capital and most population along the Mekong River valley. The Southern Region (Champasack, Attapeu, Salavan) has the Bolaven Plateau known for coffee production and the Mekong's 4,000 Islands. The Annamite Range forms the eastern border with Vietnam, while the Mekong River defines much of the western border with Thailand. Regional development varies significantly, with Vientiane Capital being most developed and remote mountain areas having limited infrastructure.",

      "question": "How does agriculture shape Laos' economy and rural livelihoods?",
      "answer": "Agriculture employs 65% of Laos' population and contributes 15% to GDP, making it crucial for livelihoods despite climate vulnerabilities. Rice is the staple crop covering 60% of agricultural land, with production concentrated in Mekong River plains and lowland areas. The Bolaven Plateau produces high-quality coffee for export, while northern provinces grow maize and cash crops. Subsistence farming dominates in remote areas with limited market access. Climate challenges include drought affecting rain-fed rice, flooding destroying crops, and unpredictable weather disrupting planting seasons. Government programs promote climate-smart agriculture, improved varieties, and irrigation infrastructure to build resilience.",

      "question": "What renewable energy potential does Laos have beyond hydropower?",
      "answer": "While hydropower dominates, Laos has substantial untapped renewable potential. Solar energy potential is significant with 1,400-1,700 kWh/m² annually, particularly in southern provinces like Champasack and Attapeu. The government targets 1,000 MW of solar capacity by 2030 with several utility-scale projects under development. Wind energy resources exist in mountainous northern regions and elevated plateaus, though detailed assessments are ongoing. Biomass potential from rice husks, wood waste, and agricultural residues could support rural energy needs and small-scale power generation. Mini-hydropower systems (under 15 MW) offer opportunities for rural electrification in remote mountainous areas. The National Energy Strategy emphasizes diversifying beyond large hydropower to include distributed renewable energy systems.",
